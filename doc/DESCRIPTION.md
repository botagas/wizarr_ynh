Wizarr is an automatic user invitation system for Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby that makes it easy to invite friends and family to your media server.

## Key Features

- **Automatic invitations** for Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, AudiobookShelf, Komga, Kavita and Romm
- **Setup guides** for media apps to help users get started
- **Customizable invitation access** with customizable permissions
- **Time-limited membership options** for temporary access

## How it works

Instead of the complicated process of manually inviting users to your media server, Wizarr creates unique invite links that you can share. When users click the link, they're automatically added to your server and guided through downloading apps, accessing request systems, and more!
